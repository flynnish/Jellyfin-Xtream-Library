# Jellyfin Xtream Library

A Jellyfin plugin that syncs Xtream VOD, Series, and Live TV content to native Jellyfin libraries. STRM-based movies and series with universal client compatibility, plus a native Live TV tuner with full EPG support.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **STRM File Sync**: Creates `.strm` files containing streaming URLs for Movies and Series
- **Native Libraries**: Content appears in standard Jellyfin Movie/TV Show libraries
- **Universal Compatibility**: Works with all Jellyfin clients including Swiftfin, Infuse, and web
- **Automatic Metadata**: Jellyfin fetches rich metadata from TMDB/TVDb

### Live TV
- **Native Tuner Host**: Registers as a Jellyfin tuner — no M3U tuner plugin needed
- **EPG / Programme Guide**: XMLTV endpoint with configurable days (1-14) and parallel fetching
- **Pre-Populated Stream Stats**: Fetches codec, resolution, fps, and bitrate from provider to skip FFmpeg probing
- **Catchup / Timeshift**: Replay past programmes with configurable catchup window (1-30 days)
- **Channel Name Cleaning**: Strips tags like `| HD |`, `[EN]`, `UK:`, codec info, and resolution suffixes
- **Channel Name Overrides**: Override name, number, or logo per channel (`StreamId=Name|Number|LogoUrl`)
- **Adult Channel Filtering**: Exclude adult channels from guide and playlist
- **Category Selection**: Filter Live TV channels by category (empty = all)
- **Dispatcharr Integration**: Enhanced stream stats and multi-variant stream support

### Sync Options
- **Category Filtering**: Select specific VOD, Series, and Live TV categories to sync
- **Shift+Click Selection**: Quickly select ranges of categories
- **Incremental Sync**: Only fetches changed content after the first full sync (delta-based with checksums)
- **Parallel Sync**: Configurable parallelism (1-20 concurrent requests)
- **Category Batching**: Process categories in configurable batch sizes to control memory usage
- **Smart Skip**: Skip API calls for series that already have STRM files
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable delay between API requests with automatic retry on HTTP 429
- **Real-Time Progress**: Live sync status showing categories, items, and created counts
- **Cancel Sync**: Stop sync mid-operation with the Cancel button
- **Retry Failed Items**: Re-attempt items that failed in the last sync
- **Scheduled Sync**: Choose between interval-based (every X minutes) or daily (specific time)

### Metadata Matching
- **Automatic TMDb/TVDb Lookup**: Uses Jellyfin's configured metadata providers to find IDs
- **Manual ID Overrides**: Force specific TMDb/TVDb IDs for content that doesn't match
- **Language Tag Stripping**: Removes tags like `| EN |`, `[DE]`, `(EN SPOKEN)` for better matching
- **Folder Name Formatting**: Creates folders like `Movie Name (2023) [tmdbid-12345]` for reliable matching

### Content Organization
- **Single Folder Mode**: All movies/series sync to root Movies/Series folder
- **Multiple Folder Mode**: Organize content into subfolders by category (e.g., `Movies/Kids`, `Series/Documentaries`)
- **Visual Folder UI**: Create folders and assign categories with checkboxes instead of typing IDs
- **Multi-Folder Categories**: Same category can sync to multiple folders

### Artwork & Media Info
- **Provider Artwork Download**: Downloads posters/fanart from your provider for unmatched content
- **Season Posters**: Downloads season cover art for unmatched series
- **Episode Thumbnails**: Downloads episode thumbnails for unmatched content
- **Proactive Media Info**: Fetches resolution, codec, and audio info during sync (optional)
- **NFO Sidecar Files**: Writes Kodi-compatible NFO files with streamdetails for instant media info display

### Library Management
- **Orphan Cleanup**: Removes STRM files for content no longer on the provider
- **Safety Protection**: Skips cleanup if >20% would be deleted (provider glitch protection)
- **Separate Clean Buttons**: Delete Movies or Series library content independently
- **Sync History**: View last 10 sync runs with timestamps and stats
- **Library Scan Trigger**: Automatically triggers Jellyfin scan after sync

## Why This Plugin?

The standard Xtream channel-based plugin presents content as Jellyfin "Channels" which have limited client support (particularly broken in Swiftfin). This plugin takes a different approach:

| Feature | Xtream Channels | Xtream Library (STRM) |
|---------|----------------|----------------------|
| Paradigm | Channel items | Native library items |
| Client support | Limited | Universal |
| Metadata | Plugin-managed | Jellyfin (TMDB/TVDb) |
| Collections | Not supported | Full support |
| Watch status | Channel-specific | Standard library |
| Live TV | Supported | Supported (native tuner + EPG) |

2. Click **Load Categories**
3. Check the categories you want to sync (shift+click for ranges)
4. Leave all unchecked to sync everything

### Folder Organization (Optional)

To organize content into subfolders:

1. Change **Folder Mode** to "Multiple Folders"
2. Click **+ Add Folder** to create a folder (e.g., "Kids")
3. Check the categories to include in that folder
4. Repeat for additional folders
5. Categories not assigned to any folder sync to the root

### Metadata Matching (Optional)

For automatic TMDb/TVDb ID lookup:

1. Ensure TMDb and/or TVDb plugins are installed in Jellyfin
2. Enable **Automatic Metadata ID Lookup** in plugin settings
3. For content that doesn't match, add manual overrides:
   - Movies: `The Matrix (1999)=603`
   - Series: `Breaking Bad (2008)=81189`

### Live TV Setup

1. Go to the **Live TV** tab in plugin settings
2. Enable **Live TV**
3. Click **Load Categories** and select the Live TV categories you want
4. Enable **Native Tuner** to register as a Jellyfin tuner (recommended)

## Troubleshooting

### STRM files not playing

1. Verify the stream URL works in a browser/VLC
2. Check Jellyfin logs for connection errors
3. Ensure your provider allows your IP/device
4. Try a different container extension in provider settings

### Metadata not loading

1. Ensure library type is set correctly (Movies/TV Shows)
2. Check that TMDB/TVDb plugins are enabled and configured
3. Enable "Automatic Metadata ID Lookup" for better matching
4. Add manual ID overrides for problematic content
5. Try refreshing metadata manually

### Content missing

1. Check sync logs in Jellyfin dashboard
2. Verify the category is selected in plugin settings
3. Run a manual sync and check for errors
4. Look for the content in failed items list

### Sync is slow

1. Increase sync parallelism (default: 10)
2. Enable "Smart Skip Existing" to skip unchanged content
3. Disable "Proactive Media Info" if not needed
4. Select only the categories you need

### Live TV not showing channels

1. Verify Live TV is enabled in plugin settings
2. Check that at least one Live TV category is selected
3. Ensure the native tuner is enabled
4. Go to Dashboard → Live TV and check that the tuner is detected
5. Refresh the Live TV cache from plugin settings
